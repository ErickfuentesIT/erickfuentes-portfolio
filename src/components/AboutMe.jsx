      <h2>About me 👨‍💻</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a computer science technician and data analyst with almost 2 years
        of experience developing solutions for large corporate and banking
        clients at PBS El Salvador with Quadient. Recently I started working and
        designing on front-end solutions with Figma and React, expanding my
        skill set beyond back-end and data processes. I'm passionate about
        continuous learning and driven by the challenge building efficient
        applications. I aim to grow into a well-rounded developer, contributing
        to products that combine robust architecture, clean code, and great user
        experience.
